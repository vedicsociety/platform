/*
This component logs basic details of the request and response using the Logger service created in Chapter 32.
The ResponseWriter interface doesn’t provide access to the status code sent in a response
and so a LoggingResponseWriter is created and passed to the next component in the pipeline.
This component performs actions before and after the next function is invoked, logging a message before passing on the request
 and logging another message that writes out the status code after the request has been processed.

 This component obtains a Logger service when it processes a request.
 We could obtain a Logger just once, but that works only because we know that the Logger has been registered as a singleton service.
 Instead, we prefer not to make assumptions about the Logger lifecycle, which means that we won’t get unexpected results
  if the lifecycle is changed in the future.
